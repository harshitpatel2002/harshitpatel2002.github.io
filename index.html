				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					ReactJS is a famous JavaScript library used to build user
					interfaces. It was developed by Facebook in 2013. Soon after
					the launch, it gained a wide popularity amongst developers
					because with React, the developer have to write less amount
					of code and now they have relieved with the most annoying
					thing when building a website i.e., Page Refresh. Yeah, that
					is one of the things devs. like about React. What?
					Interested in knowing how this works. No worries I got you!

				<h2>Getting started with ReactJS</h2>
				<p>
					To use React, you need to install nodejs which is a server
					side technology that allows to write JavaScript on server
					side. To download nodejs: link to the website 'website-link'
				</p>
				<p>Now,</p>
				<div class="gettingstarted-process-container">
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							Open the terminal window.1. Open the terminal window
						</li>
						<li>
							Type, "node –version". It will show the node version
							that you have installed. If it throws error, that
							means node is not installed properly.
						</li>
						<li>
							Then, type npx create-react-app app-name to create a
							new react app. It may take a few minutes to setup.
							<img src="" alt="Image goes here" />
						</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="gettingstarted-output-container">
						<h5>
							You will see something like this on your terminal
							screen.
						</h5>
						<img src="" alt="Image goes here" />
						<p>
							Hurrah! You got this. Now write cd app-name to go to
							the folder directory and write npm start. Don’t
							worry about anything, at start even if you don’t
							understand things just go with the flow. App will
							run on the browser at 3000 port.
						</p>

				<h2>Hello World</h2>
				<p>
					Just ask yourself and think about the first language that
					you have learn. Which program did you make. Was it hello
					world? Off course, we will make it over here as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Open the <App /> component. Yeah yeah, I know you are not
					familiar with components, and what is this <App /> thing.
					But as I say go with the flow. You will understand each and
					every thing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now , erase the 'header' tag. I mean everything written in
					it.
				</p>
				<p>Now just write Hello World in h1 tag. Like this.</p>
				<img src="" alt="Image goes here" />
				<p>
					Save it and check the browser, Hello World is now printed on
					the web page. We have made our first React App. But don’t
					get crazy, there is much more to learn about React. Let’s
					dig in

				<h2>What is JSX?</h2>
				<p>
					In simple terms, JSX is nothing but extraordinary HTML, that
					means you can also include JavaScript code into it. React
					understands JSX, not plain HTML.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="jsx-why-container">
				<h2>Why JSX?</h2>
				<p>
					With JSX you can also build the logic to manipulate the UI,
					along with the HTML code itself. This created lot of
					flexibility of doing the things together rather than
					creating different files we used to do before such as
					index.html, style.css, app.js. JSX is enough capable to
					writing all the things together.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="jsx-rules-container">
				<h2>Rules in order to use JSX</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>All the JSX should be written in return statement.</li>
					<li>
						JSX don’t allow multiple tags inside it. It should only
						have one main tag.
					</li>
					<li>
						&lt;/&gt; is a special kind of tag that is used in JSX
						as a main tag.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="jsx-use-container">
				<h2>Using JSX</h2>
				<p>
					Enough theory. Let’s write some code to get a practical idea
					about JSX.
