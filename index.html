				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					ReactJS is a famous JavaScript library used to build user
					interfaces. It was developed by Facebook in 2013. Soon after
					the launch, it gained a wide popularity amongst developers
					because with React, the developer have to write less amount
					of code and now they have relieved with the most annoying
					thing when building a website i.e., Page Refresh. Yeah, that
					is one of the things devs. like about React. What?
					Interested in knowing how this works. No worries I got you!

				<h2>Getting started with ReactJS</h2>
				<p>
					To use React, you need to install nodejs which is a server
					side technology that allows to write JavaScript on server
					side. To download nodejs: link to the website 'website-link'
				</p>
				<p>Now,</p>
				<div class="gettingstarted-process-container">
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							Open the terminal window.1. Open the terminal window
						</li>
						<li>
							Type, "node –version". It will show the node version
							that you have installed. If it throws error, that
							means node is not installed properly.
						</li>
						<li>
							Then, type npx create-react-app app-name to create a
							new react app. It may take a few minutes to setup.
							<img src="" alt="Image goes here" />
						</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="gettingstarted-output-container">
						<h5>
							You will see something like this on your terminal
							screen.
						</h5>
						<img src="" alt="Image goes here" />
						<p>
							Hurrah! You got this. Now write cd app-name to go to
							the folder directory and write npm start. Don’t
							worry about anything, at start even if you don’t
							understand things just go with the flow. App will
							run on the browser at 3000 port.

				<h2>React Fundamentals</h2>

			<div class="helloworld-container">
				<h2>Hello World</h2>
				<p>
					Just ask yourself and think about the first language that
					you have learn. Which program did you make. Was it hello
					world? Off course, we will make it over here as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Open the <App /> component. Yeah yeah, I know you are not
					familiar with components, and what is this <App /> thing.
					But as I say go with the flow. You will understand each and
					every thing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now , erase the 'header' tag. I mean everything written in
					it.
				</p>
				<p>Now just write Hello World in h1 tag. Like this.</p>
				<img src="" alt="Image goes here" />
				<p>
					Save it and check the browser, Hello World is now printed on
					the web page. We have made our first React App. But don’t
					get crazy, there is much more to learn about React. Let’s
					dig in

		<section class="jsx">
			<div class="jsx-what-container">
				<h2>What is JSX?</h2>
				<p>
					In simple terms, JSX is nothing but extraordinary HTML, that
					means you can also include JavaScript code into it. React
					understands JSX, not plain HTML.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="jsx-why-container">
				<h2>Why JSX?</h2>
				<p>
					With JSX you can also build the logic to manipulate the UI,
					along with the HTML code itself. This created lot of
					flexibility of doing the things together rather than
					creating different files we used to do before such as
					index.html, style.css, app.js. JSX is enough capable to
					writing all the things together.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="jsx-rules-container">
				<h2>Rules in order to use JSX</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>All the JSX should be written in return statement.</li>
					<li>
						JSX don’t allow multiple tags inside it. It should only
						have one main tag.
					</li>
					<li>
						&lt;/&gt; is a special kind of tag that is used in JSX
						as a main tag.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="jsx-use-container">
				<h2>Using JSX</h2>
				<p>
					Enough theory. Let’s write some code to get a practical idea
					about JSX.

			<div class="components-intro-container">
				<h1>Components</h1>
				<p>
					Components are a piece of code that you can use repeatedly
					if you want.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="components-about-container">
				<p>
					React follows the pattern of using component so that if
					changes need to be made, we just have to do it once. Also,
					components like Navbar and Footer can be re-use in every
					page. It increases the readability. Whenever you need the
					component, you can load it over there.
				</p>
				<p>JSX components follows Pascal convention.</p>
				<p>How to make components and render them?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="component-program-container">
				<h2>Task:</h2>
				<p>
					Create a component that greets Good Morning with user’s name
					and load it into &lt;App&gt; component.
				</p>
				<div class="component-program-solution-container">
					<p>
						Create a new component Greet.jsx in the source folder.
						And write a greet program.

						How to use the Greet component in the App component?

					<p>Import the <Greet /> component and use it like this</p>

						New and preferred way of writing components. Same as
						normal JS functions.
					</p>
					<img src="" alt="functional components" />
					<p>Clean and simple.</p>
					<p class="note">
						Note: All the progams will be written in function based

		<section class="props">
			<div class="props-intro-container">
				<h2>What are props?</h2>
				<p>
					Props are nothing but short of properties. You can pass some
					properties to a component when you call it. The component
					will take all the props and can use those values where it
					wants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Props can be passed as a plain text or as any JS variables
					such as Integer, Object, Boolean etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other component will receive these props in a props JSON
					object.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="props-usage-container">
				<p>
					Learning this kind of library needs hands on practice rather
					than memorising the theory. Let’s write some code then.
				</p>
				<img src="" alt="Image goes here" />
				<p>
					Passing the name and message to the &lt;Greet/&gt;
					component.
				</p>
				<img src="" alt="Image goes here" />
				<p class="important">
					&lt;Greet/&gt; component will receive the props as a JSON
					object like this.
				</p>
				<img src="" alt="Image goes here" />
				<p>
					Now, &lt;Greet/&gt; can use the values of name and message
					and use it throughout the component.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					You must use the same name that were used while passing the
					props.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yayy! Now you can use the <Greet /> component to greet
					different people. Just pass different props every time.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					You cannot change the value of props. They are read-only. I
					know you are wondering that they may be some instances when
					the UI will change. Yeah we do have something spicy for that
					later on.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="defprops-proptypes-container">
				<h3>Default Props and Proptypes</h3>
				<p>
					One can assign default props, if the component did not
					receive that prop, it will use the default one. Also, we can
					mention proptypes, like name must be a string, If a string
					is not passed, it will throw an error.
				</p>

			<div class="architecture-intro-container">
				<h1>React Architecture</h1>
				<p>
					I am sure you were waiting for this. I know that without
					being familiar with the environment, things are not clear to
					us. So let’s understand how React works and will go thorough
					the folder structure as well.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="architecture-folder-structure-container">
				<h3>Folder Structure</h3>
				<img src="" alt="Folder structure" />
				<h4>Entry file: index.js</h4>
				<p>
					Responsible to load the App component in the index.html
					file. All the components don’t matter already made by React
					for us or you create must be place in the source folder. You
					may put in some directory to make things organise but it
					should be in the src folder.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the application starts. Index.js target the div with
					class ‘root’ present in the index.html file and loads the
					App component in that div.
				</p>
				<p>
					You must be wondering why we do all these things when we can
					create different .html files and send them to the browser.
					But the disadvantage in that is every time a browser request
					for a page, server will send the whole html page which can
					take much bandwidth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead, what React developers thought, we will keep only
					one .html file and we will manipulate the content according
					to the UI we need. So now, JS is responsible for changing
					the UI. This is the reason why page doesn’t get refresh.
					Because browser is not making any other requests. On the
					very first request, it took the .html file and now we are
					just changing the data of the file however we need.
				</p>
				<p>
					Isn’t that beautiful. Now the process will be much faster.

				<h3>What is a State?</h3>
				<p>
					Remember, I have told before that we have something spicy
					for storing values. Let's discuss the spicyness of React
					state.
				</p>
				<p>
					State is nothing but the current appearance or position of a
					component
				</p>
				<p>
					In react, we can use state when we know at some point the
					state of that component will be changed.
				</p>
				<p>
					In function-based components, we have hooks to manage state.
					Now you must be wondering what are
					<strong>hooks</strong> now.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Hooks</strong> were included in React 16.8. They
					help us to manage to state in functional components. There
					are a bunch of Hooks present in React library. Hook for
					using state in functional components is useState.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="stateandhooks-usage-container">
				<h3>Usage</h3>
				<img src="" alt="" />
				<img src="" alt="" />
				<img src="" alt="" />
				<img src="" alt="" />
				<p>
					Felt amazed? Using states you can manage a large application
					in an efficient way. But the only way to update the state in
					the functional component is by its setter method.
				</p>
				<p>const [name, setName] = useState(‘’);</p>
				<p>We cannot do something like this. Name = “New Name”</p>
				<p>Correct way: setName(“New Name”)</p>
